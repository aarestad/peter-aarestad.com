<p>My name is Peter, a 39-year-old programmer for GrubHub&Acirc;&nbsp;working and living in Chicago. I'm a lifelong Lutheran, a big Linux nerd, and an avid gamer, as well as a recovering WoWaholic. I plan to use this space to share my thoughts about my life in gaming, work, and faith as the spirit moves me any particular day. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
