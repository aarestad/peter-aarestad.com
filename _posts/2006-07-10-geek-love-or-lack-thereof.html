<p>So I'm single. Have been for about a year now, since my last relationship of any consequence, a 1-month something-or-other with a woman I met on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.eharmony.com">eHarmony<&#47;a>. One of the most frustrating parts of this past year has been having to put off dating. Who would want to hear the bitching and moaning of a guy who isn't sure he's doing the right thing by pursuing a Ph. D. (an endavour I'll talk more about in a future post)? I did have a couple of eHarmony dates during the fall quarter at NU, but they fizzled, probably as much due to my own ambivalence as anything else.</p>
<p>Ambivalence.</p>
<p>I use that word a lot, since it describes a lot of what I've been dealing with this past year. Ambivalence about grad school - yeah, I'm smart, but do I want to do hard-core research? Ambivalence about women - what the hell do I even want out of a relationship? Ambivalance about myself - for that matter, who the hell am I?!</p>
<p>I have had a rather frustrating dating career. I've only had three relationships of any significant consequence, spaced out over seven years. I'll spare the details out of respect for the other principals involved, but in general, each of the three relationships taught me more about myself and who I want. So who am I?</p>
<ul>
<li>A geeky guy who loves computers and occasionally likes chatting about them<&#47;li>
<li>An avid WoW enthusiast who plays not just for the challenge of competition, but the enjoyment of the company of friends<&#47;li>
<li>A compassionate, empathetic guy who cares deeply about my friends<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
There's more, but that's a good start. :) As for what I'm looking for...</p>
<ul>
<li>A humble, caring woman who likes to talk and is honest<&#47;li>
<li>Someone who likes many different activities - WoW optional ;)<&#47;li>
<li>Someone who is affectionate and who enjoys receiving affection<&#47;li>
<li>Did I mention caring? She should be concerned for others and willing to look outside just herself and me<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
OK, so I don't mean for this to be my own little online personal or something. :P This is all to say that I'm still trying to work these things out.</p>
<p>One more thought: WoW has been an interesting horizon for me to really explore who I truly am. When freed of having to worry about certain social niceties like making my hair look nice or whatever, I can just let me be myself. It's been a revelation - mind you, I'm not looking to be an online pimp daddy or something, though. I'm just looking to be me. On the whole, though, I've felt much more liberated: I can start to break free of some of the repressive feelings I've put on myself over the years, mostly due to my own inability to accept that, yeah, I <strong>deserve<&#47;strong> to be happy, dammit! That's what 9 months of therapy will do - also to be described in more detail in a future entry.</p>
<p>So, yeah. I may stil be single, but I'm more hopeful than ever that the right woman is just around the corner, and I'll be ready for her.</p>
