<p>I found out today it will be "three to four weeks" until I am able to close on my condo. This comes one week after the nominal close date specified in the contract I signed back in June, a date the selling agent had agreed to in advance. This whole situation is frustrating beyond belief. I hiave never felt so powerless over a situation. Everyone on "my side" is assuring me that they are working their hardest to resolve this situation. But there's nothing I can do. The ironic part of all this is that my preparedness to get everything lined up for the new condo is actually working against me. I've had to call ATT, DirecTV, Comcast, etc. to let them know that, no, I am not actually moving when I said I was.</p>
<p>So now I go into a holding pattern. Thankfully, I was able to extend my lease of my apartment in Evanston for a month while this nonsense gets sorted out. There's really just nothing to say. I was hoping to make a post here explain the process and what's holding me up, but frankly, I just don't have the energy right now. I've been spending too much time today just feeling defeated. It's really all I can muster right now; just that feeling of "well crap, there's nothing I can do". Everything's on hold: my new place to live, the settling in, my parents coming to visit my new place, getting a dog. All of it has to wait. It's all incredibly unfair; I just want to scream and cry, but what good can that do?</p>
<p>Ugh. That's about all I can muster now. Just, ugh. :(</p>
