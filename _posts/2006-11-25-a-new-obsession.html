  content: "You can have Drew Barrymore; just keep your mental hands off Rosario Dawson.
    Mmm, she's so pretty! And she's a total comic book geek. OK, so I did meet her
    this one time, but I didn't really meet her because I was standing there and I
    couldn't think of anything to say without sounding like a complete dweeb so I
    just took pictures of her and the two people dressed as Marv and Kevin from Sin
    City. I don't think I drooled on myself until after I walked away, so that's good.\r\n\r\nYeah,
    chance of getting with her = 0 so she's me fantasy. It used to be Jennifer Connelly
    but Rosario has that geek&#47;nerd thing to her. It's like an automatic +3 sexy
    modifier. Anyway, she will be mine, oh yes, one day she will be mine. MWAAHAHHAHAH!"

<p>Too often over the last few months, I've found myself obsessing over someone. Not in the sense of "oh god, I wish I could be with them", even though they have invariably been women, but in the sense of "wow, they're so amazing, I need to remain friends with them". I meet these people and then get it in my head that, unless I remain close personal friends with them, I am somehow less of a good person. Well, I intend for that to change as of now. Whenever, I get the urge to obsess over someone, I'm going to direct my obsessions to Drew Barrymore.</p>
<p>Seriously, why not? She's pretty, funny, got a great smile, and would totally date me if she knew me. I can cook up elaborate fantasies about me and her and never have it be awkward, since the probability that I will ever actually meet her is about 0. No harm done. Easy as pie.</p>
<p>But yeah, that's my goal. Last night, as I was mulling this over in my head, it seemed to work out so well. A lot of clouds were lifted from my head and things seemed fairly easy to deal with now. My hope is that I can perpetuate this feeling and not have to worry about future obsessions... hopefully.</p>
