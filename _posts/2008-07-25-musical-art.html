<p>So I've been listening to <a title="Pandora" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.pandora.com" target="_blank">Pandora Radio<&#47;a> a bunch lately. It is an amazing site, especially to test-drive new artists. In my case, I've been listening to stations based on <a title="Imogen Heap" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.imogenheap.co.uk&#47;" target="_blank">Imogen Heap<&#47;a> and <a title="Regina Spektor" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.reginaspektor.com&#47;" target="_blank">Regina Spektor<&#47;a>. They're both solo female artist singer-songwriters, but their styles differ quite a bit. Imogen tends to do a lot of heavily-overdubbed songs with layers on layers of vocals and various instruments, with the vocals occasionally transformed via a <a title="What's a Vocoder?" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Vocoder">vocoder<&#47;a>, notably in her famous and gorgeous song "<a title="Hide and Seek video" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=5cpSv2mNhhc">Hide and Seek<&#47;a>". Regina Spektor comes from the anti-folk movement in NYC, a stupidly-named scene that takes a lot of the musical traditions of Dylan and such and carries them forward to the present day with various lyrical themes. Her music is spare; about half of her songs are just her and a piano. "<a title="Video for Samson" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=p62rfWxs6a8" target="_blank">Samson<&#47;a>" is a song from her latest album that came out a couple years ago, a gorgeous little ditty about first love viewed in retrospect.</p>
<p>Inspiring music. Gorgeous, amazing songs that make me wish I could write music like this. It's so sucky. I played violin and piano for years, but as a kid, I just never got into it. I was much more into playing games on my Nintendo than practicing those instruments. Perhaps it was my way of passive-aggresively rebelling against authority and all the duties I felt were pressing in on me. I blew it, in any case. I could go on psychoanalzying myself, but the point of all this was to say, just, wow, I really wish I could get these kind of soundscapes in my mind that these people seem to be able to do. One thing I want to do with my new condo (when I actually can move into it! arrrrgh) is pick up a keyboard and start trying to relearn some piano chops and try my had at a little composition with Garage Band. I have no illusions of ever becoming anything like Imogen or Regina (and what is it with me and female artists?...), but I'd just love to be creative again somehow. WoW is fun and all, but it is ultimately not at all a creative endeavor, in the literal sense that nothing is created through your time playing the game. It's the social aspect that makes it interesting, and why I'm still with the group of friends I've been with for almost 2 years now, save a couple months early last year.</p>
<p>Meh, as usual, I'm rambling more than saying anything interesting. But yeah. Friday afternoons are a great time to think about life, since you don't have much else to do. :P</p>
<p>Peace.</p>
