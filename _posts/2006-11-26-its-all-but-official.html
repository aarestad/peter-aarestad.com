  content: "I've been keeping up with your blog here and I sympathize. I regret not
    having commented earlier, but the entries I wanted to comment on you deleted,
    silly man. Still, no excuse for me. I know it's useless to tell you to \"get over
    it\" because it's both unsympathetic and doesn't freaking work anyway. I've been
    there, where you are right now, about two years ago. I know what it's like, or
    something similar to it.\r\n\r\nTalk to your therapist, and tell her everything
    that's bothering you. Just getting it out will make you feel a little better and
    she'll help you take the next set of steps necessary to improve your life. It's
    a good start.\r\n\r\nI know I've been offline for almost two weeks; I've been
    taking care of family business. I've missed you, though. I'll see you online,
    in WoW or IM, I hope.\r\n\r\nMif"

  content: Peter, I happened upon your blog by visiting Dr. George's -- kind of strolling

  content: "I can't get over how I see you in game and you seem like this happy-go-lucky
    great guy and then I read about what you are going through on here and am shocked
    to find how bad it has gotten for you. You completely matter sweetie. And if those
    of us who do not have a flesh and blood connection to you count, then your real
    life family and friends surely do. No wants to see you just disappear one day.
    You would be leaving a hole that would be very hard for a lot of us to fill. Hang
    in there sweetie. You only get one go around on this big green ball and I would
    hate to think that people like you are ending their journey prematurely. The world
    needs more of you, not less. >>\r\n\r\nMugwum"

<p>Well, let's see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of energy and motivation<&#47;li>
<li>Reduced appetite<&#47;li>
<li>Changing sleeping patterns<&#47;li>
<li>Almost complete lack of sense of humor<&#47;li>
<li>and, of course, lots of sadness<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
I'm no psychiatrist, but it certainly sounds like I have clinical depression. The sickness has caused me to be in isolation for a long, long time, and it's finally starting to affect me in profound ways. I've been having flashes of good moments, but I can't seem to perpetuate them. The worst part is trying to explain myself to everyone I know. My friends and family mean well, but they try to reason with me, and it's clear that I can't be reasoned with.</p>
<p>I've also thought about suicide more often in the past week or so than I usually do. Mind you, plans never seem to come to mind, although I did even start making plans last night. I never get any farther than thinking about it, though - it's as if a mental block sets in preventing me from going any further, protecting myself. Believe me, I'm quite grateful for it.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm going to call my therapist today and leave a message with her. If there's anyone out there reading it, I have one favor to ask of you. Please just write me a little note or something - comment here on this blog, email, something - letting me know that you're out there thinking of me. The largest distortion in my mind right now is that noone cares if I live or die; my life matters to noone. I know it sounds selfish, but please remind me that I matter.</p>
