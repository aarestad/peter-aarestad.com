<p>OK, on to geeky stuff again, finally. :D The big Patch 2.0 is dropping in WoW next week. This means free respecs for everyone, including my prot warrior. <a target="_blank" title="My respec" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.wowhead.com&#47;?talent-bc=TVZZ0EtohMdcest">Here's<&#47;a> what I've come up with for a spec. I'm gonna miss the +5% crit that comes from Cruelty, but I'll deal. Focused Rage should make my hate generation a bit better across the board by reducing the rage required for all my abilities; in particular, Revenge should drop to 2 rage! I skipped over Imp Sunder since I'll only be using it enough to get 5 sunders on a target, then switching over to spam Devastate. Imp Defensive Stance and Shield Mastery will reduce my damage taken significantly - the former will be even more useful in later end-game encounters where a lot of the damage is magical in nature, not physical. And after wiping repeatedly on Huhuran the last few weeks with Dj&Atilde;&para;rk, I think the 2 points in Imp Shield Wall will definitely help us out a lot when every second of survivability matters. It's just too bad Improved Disciplines is so deep in the Arms tree - that would be a very, very nice thing to have for everyone, including us Prot warriors.</p>
<p>Oh, and one thing I just noticed! Last Stand is an <strong>8<&#47;strong>-minute cooldown now, not 10. That'll make it a lot handier to use. Fun stuff! I'm looking forward to next Tuesday - well, at least for the talents, not the likely server instability... :(</p>
