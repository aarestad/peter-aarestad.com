  content: "Oh! I keep forgetting to post this, but now I've finally remembered:\r\nIf
    you ever get a respiratory attack again bad enough to warrant a 911 Call, don't
    worry about whether or not you can actually talk or not. They can trace the call
    and send a police officer&#47;ambulance to your house&#47;apartment anyway. This
    was done in cases of burglary where the caller can't talk without giving away
    his location to the intruders.\r\n\r\nSo next time just make the call. I think
    they'll get the point if all they hear is asthmatic breathing."

<p>...to those people who've been sending me supportive notes lately. I appreciate it more than you'll ever know that, wow, I actually do matter to some people! I mean, it's not like I've every been totally abandoned. I have an amazing family with a mom and dad that have done nothing but love me and care for me all these years... yet I get stuck in these moments of depression. It just goes to show you that depression isn't about whether or not you're smart or thinking straight or whatever - it's dictated by plain old biochemistry.</p>
<p>I'll be seeing my therapist again on Saturday, and we'll work out the next steps on fighting this stuff. While I have been feeling much more cheerful (and much less sick!) these last few days, I just want to be careful and not assume that everything will be fine forever.</p>
<p>So again, thank you all.</p>
