  content: "Have fun.\r\n\r\nI can empathize with that second paragraph there, I asked
    myself that (a large power of 2) times growing up.  \"Why do I feel like shit
    so much when I've got everything everyone ever wanted?  I'm smart, I have relatively
    good parents, some great friends, etc, etc.  I even have a big dick!  WTF!\"\r\n\r\nI'm
    still not what you would call \"happy\", but I'm certainly closer than I was even
    last year[1].  Most of it involved stopping the process of blaming myself for
    doing&#47;not doing things in the past that were due to factors I couldn't control,
    but didn't realize it at the time (i.e. forgiving myself, if you prefer that language).
    \ \r\n\r\n(Previous to getting on medication, I couldn't really control my behaviour
    in the long term, so I felt horribly guilty about a ton of stuff from my past
    -- failing out of my first attempt at university, getting fired from a shitty
    job in high school.  I still even felt guilty for breaking a ceramic figurine
    in a store when I was five or six by hitting it with a hula hoop I was playing
    with -- my dad paid $2 for it, but I still felt guilty for it occasionally.  Everyone
    keeps telling me that there is&#47;should be some kind of blame there for my parent's
    divorce, but I don't really buy that -- I've pretty much always blamed my mom
    for that.)\r\n\r\nAnd work.... where do you work?  Most work (especially IT work)
    is utterly void of meaning.  Even if your project is a massive success, you're
    helping some company shave off 0.5% of their expenses or something insignificant.
    \ You have to enjoy the work, not look for meaning in it.  (I work in a company
    that makes digital advertisement signs -- talk about devoid of meaning.  I write
    code to pollute your psychological environment!)\r\n\r\n[1] Thank you, psychopharmacology."

  content: "Ahh, you're a Java programmer.  That would explain the void of feeling.\r\n\r\nPick
    up a cool language like Erlang, Common Lisp or even Perl 6 on the side for fun.
    Then hit up <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;projecteuler.net&#47;\" rel=\"nofollow\">Project
    Euler<&#47;a> and start playing around.  I've enjoyed my work a hundred fold since
    I started to write in other languages in my spare time.\r\n\r\nThe link to the
    game I mentioned <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;crawl-ref.sourceforge.net&#47;\" rel=\"nofollow\">the
    other day<&#47;a>.  It's so much cooler than Nethack it hurts.  I've found a Hill
    Orc Berzerker to be the easiest to start with, although a Spriggan Transmuter
    was definitely the most fun."

<p>So I'm leaving for a while for my parents' place starting Friday 6&#47;29 - I'll be back in Chicago around on July 8. One thing I am going to try to do while gone is get my mind back in order. I have been spiraling pretty quickly down into a pseudo-depression yet again, and I've been lashing out at friends along the way, people who have gone out of their way to help me and listen to me. At least a few friends this past week have told me they're fed up with it. The more tightly I cling, the more desperate I become, and it's just getting worse. My greatest fear is losing friends - I just haven't had much luck in keeping them because of my extreme self-consciousness. Every little thing - every well-meaning ribbing, misspoken word, everything negative becomes amplified. Everything positive becomes diminished. It's worse than seeing the world in purely black and white with no shades of grey - eventually you only see black.</p>
<p>It's even gotten to the point where it's affecting my work - nothing I do there seems to matter, and these roller-coaster rides of emotion I've been on are getting worse and worse. What's even more terrible is comparing my own situation with those around me - what the hell do I even have to complain about? I have a great job, loving parents, awesome friends. How dare I complain?</p>
<p>And yet, I do. It's a tough spot to be in. So anyway, to those I've hurt (I'm talking especially to you, Muzz&#47;Dave), I apologize. You guys, my friends, have given a lot of yourself that I cannot repay. Maybe I'll find my way back to sanity, maybe I won't. Please be assured that I'm trying, though. Also know that I'm not blaming anyone for the state I'm in - not even myself. It is what it is. I don't expect pity or condolences or anything - I just wanted you guys to know where I am right now.</p>
