<p>Oy, I've been a total slackass about blogging lately. Lots of stuff going on. Orbitz is history, and I've been working as a contractor for a printing middleman company called <a title="InnerWorkings" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.inwk.com&#47;" target="_blank">InnerWorkings<&#47;a>. The headquarters are in the old Montgomery Ward warehouse on Chicago Ave. right on the Chicago River. This building is almost 100 years old, but you'd never know it - it's been completely gutted and refurbished to make a brand-spanking-new office complex.</p>
<p>It's also not too far from... my new <a title="My new condo!" href="http:&#47;&#47;maps.google.com&#47;maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=1532+N+Campbell+Ave,+Chicago,+IL+60622&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=47.751524,66.972656&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=41.912002,-87.689202&amp;spn=0.011034,0.016351&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=41.909073,-87.689637&amp;panoid=cdu85jmJRb5AL6lUO3KUHA">condo<&#47;a>! Well, not "mine" yet, but my offer was accepted last week, so I've now started down the path of having to hoard a ridiculous amount of money for the down payment, closing fees, inspections, and God-knows-whatever-else between now and the actual closing day, which is tentatively July 21. In the interim, I'm learning a ton about mortgages, short sales, and all sorts of the weird arcanery surrounding buying a home (or condo).</p>
<p>I'll be honest - I've never been very good with money. Not that I've ever been in much trouble financially - I've done pretty well by the fact that I'm a techie guy and my skills are fairly well sought-after. So I've come into this whole process with a good deal of naivete. Fortunately, I've been working with people (my Realtor and loan agent in particular) who have been very knowledgable at telling me what I need to do, how to raise the money, and so forth. The one big thing I've had to do that was sort of against my will was liquidate a bunch of my Roth IRA holdings. Never a good thing to part with your retirement account, but I figured this was for a good cause since I was able to get such a good deal on this condo. Basically, it's what is called a "short sale", meaning the current owners are about to be foreclosed, and the bank wants to sell the property ASAP to get some sort of value on the soon-to-be-defunct mortgage. This means they're less flexible in the terms, however, so I had to basically put in a single offer and hope it would be accepted - thankfully, it was. Now I have to spend the next 5-6 weeks scraping together every last dime to be able to show the banks that, yes, I can afford to do this and I am not totally bankrupt.</p>
<p>It's all very crazy, and I've spent a couple recent nights lying awake in various states of panic as to how I was going to be able to pull all this together. Thankfully, it's coming together nicely, it seems, so I'll be able to sleep tonight, at least. :) More details (and pictures) as they come in...</p>
