<p>Work was going fairly smoothly today - I was getting a lot done and was feeling pretty happy. I brought some nice clothes with me to work, which is a bit unusual - normally I just wear jeans and a T-shirt to work (though I was also wearing a sweatshirt since the temperature was 6 above zero this morning...) - but tonight we were having our holiday party at Orbitz! I was pretty jazzed up and feeling pretty good about the day. It all started to get a little weird in the middle of the afternoon, though...</p>
<p>About 3:15, as I was coding away finishing up some last-minute changes for the little product I'm working on, I started hearing a bunch of sirens. Unusual, I thought - must be a fire or something around here or in the Loop. (I work just a couple blocks west of the Loop proper - an area usually called the "West Loop".) A few minutes later, I see a strobe light go off. Now, close by me sit the IT people who are kind of wild and like to be a bit crazy, so I thought maybe at first it was just a desk toy. I glanced up, and saw that the strobe light was actually the fire alarm system. I started to get up to prepare to evacuate when I heard a voice over the intercom: "We have an emergency situation. Please stay on your floor, lock the doors, and do not leave your suite." Uh-oh - this sounds dangerous. My boss, when she heard that, immediately commented "Someone's gone postal." Unfortunately, we didn't have the slightest clue what was going on. People started milling about, looking outside as we saw the emergency vehicles (whose sirens I had heard earlier) congregate outside the front of our building on Madison St.</p>
<p>Still, we had no clue what was happening. Around 4 PM, I got a message from my friend "Kavel" in Panda Attack (and like a noob, I've forgotten his real-life name...). He linked me to a story on NBC 5's web site that said there had been a shooting on one of the upper floors of our very building! Details at the time were sketchy, but it seemed my boss was right. There was a report that the gunman was still at large, making us all a bit more nervous. I spent the rest of the afternoon checking the Chicago Tribune web site, which had a running story with details as they came in - some people shot, taken out on stretchers from the building to Rush, one guy shot in the head... yipe.</p>
<p>Finally, about 5:00, we got the all-clear that everything was under control. The party still went on, but I was kind of out of it at that point, plus, I've been pretty tired this week. I grabbed a beer, and kind of nursed it while walking around looking at a whole lot of people I didn't know. I grabbed a few things to nibble on, but ultimately I just wasn't in the partying mood, and so I slipped out at about 6 PM to grab the next train home (by that time, the Metra trains had started running again - my building is also a terminal for three of the Metra lines).</p>
<p>So an odd day, to say the least. Glad it's over - I just need to relax now.</p>
